- Check that bundle is modeled properly. If bundle is not used, there
  should be no need to configure. A brief discussion indicated that the
  current optional bundling configuration and component configuration
  should be ok.
  > Done.

- Support IACD (Interface Adjustment Capability Descriptor,
  RFC6001). Plan to add IACD attributes to TE links.
  > Added.

- Support inter-domain links. Plan to add local/remote domain IDs to
  link attributes. 
  > Done.

- Add a read-only flag for protection-in-use.
  > Done.

- Add information soruce to node, so that information such as
  switching matrix can be traced to its source.
  > Added.

- Synchronize with i2rs topology models
  1. Augment ietf-network-topology: 
     a) Map ID values (2 alternatives)
     	1) Encode te-topology IDs into uri, and keep the existing IDs
           as separate attributes. 
     	2) Change base ietf-network-topology model.
     b) Map termination point
     c) Map te-link 
        A te-link is represented as a link <node, tp, node, tp> in
       ietf-network-topology. 
     
  2. Map between i2rs non-te topology models and te-topology (3 alternatives)
     1) Two data sources. In congruent cases, node IDs and link IDs
        happen to be matched in both non-te and te topologies.
     2) Add reference to te-topology. e.g. in ospf link, add a leafref
        pointing to te-topology information (te-topology id, te-link id).
     3) Define a separate TE grouping in ospf model (not prefered).
  > Done.

- Check that performance matrix related attributes are modeled properly.

- To support segment routing.
  > Decided not to model this in te-topology model.

- To add seg routing label. 
  > Decided not to model this in te-topology model.

- To add more comments and references.
  > Added some. Asking more feedbacks.

- To check if the current model for access link is sufficient.

- In connectivity matrix, remove network-ref and node-ref.
  > Done.

- In connectivity matrix, discuss whether to use "is-allowed" or
  "switching-allowed". 

- In connectivity matrix, add reference to RFC7579.
  > Done.

- In node, add alt-information-sources.
  > Done.

- Consider whether packet-switch-capable belongs to te-topology
  > Done. Moved it to a separate module ietf-te-topology-psc.yang

- Remove PSC-2 to PSC-4.
  > Done.

- Fill in organization and contact fields.
  > Done.
